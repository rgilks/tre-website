# Total Reality Engineering - Portfolio Website

A minimal, flashy portfolio showcasing innovative GitHub projects with a modern, terminal-inspired design.

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üîê GitHub API configuration

This site lists repositories via the GitHub REST API. You can run it without authentication (low rate limits), or configure a token for higher limits.

Environment variables:

```bash
# Optional: increases rate limits
export GITHUB_USERNAME="rgilks"    # or your GitHub username
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your_token>" # classic or fine-grained PAT with at least public repo read
```

Notes:

- If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, it will be sent as `Authorization: token <PAT>` (works for classic and fine-grained tokens).
- On a 401 with a provided token, the app retries unauthenticated automatically for resiliency.
- If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not set, requests are unauthenticated (no Authorization header), which may hit rate limits but should not 401.
- Make sure the token has not expired and has at least public repo read permissions.

## üìö Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm start           # Start production server

# Building
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run build:cf    # Build for Cloudflare Workers

# Testing
npm test            # Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --run   # Run tests once
npm run test:e2e    # Run Playwright e2e tests

# Code Quality
npm run lint        # Lint code
npm run type-check  # TypeScript type checking
npm run format      # Format code with Prettier
npm run check       # Run all checks (lint + type-check + format)

# Dependencies

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Cloudflare Workers (OpenNext)

This repo is configured to deploy with **OpenNext** to **Cloudflare Workers** (Pages-style static assets served by Workers).

### Prerequisites

- Create a Cloudflare Pages project (build command will be handled by the GitHub Action).
- Generate a Cloudflare API token with Pages:Edit and Account:Read permissions.

### GitHub Secrets

Add these repository secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: API token with Pages permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
  (No Pages project needed; deployment uses `wrangler deploy`.)

### Build locally (optional)

```bash
npm install
npm run build:cf
# Outputs in `.open-next/` (assets + server functions)
```

### CI/CD

On push to `main`, the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will:

1. Install deps and run `npm run check`
2. Build with `open-next --platform cloudflare`
3. Deploy Worker + assets with `wrangler deploy`

This setup mirrors the approach in the Royal Game of Ur project, which also uses Next.js Server Actions on Cloudflare Pages. See the reference repository for structure and scripts: [`rgilks/rgou-cloudflare`](https://github.com/rgilks/rgou-cloudflare).
