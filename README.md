# Total Reality Engineering - Portfolio Website

A minimal, flashy portfolio showcasing innovative GitHub projects with a modern, terminal-inspired design.

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üîê GitHub API configuration

This site lists repositories via the GitHub REST API. You can run it without authentication (low rate limits), or configure a token for higher limits.

Environment variables:

```bash
# Optional: increases rate limits
export GITHUB_USERNAME="rgilks"    # or your GitHub username
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your_token>" # classic or fine-grained PAT with at least public repo read

# Required for production: cron job authentication
export CRON_SECRET="<random_secret>" # secret key for cron job authentication

# Optional: Cloudflare Images for image hosting
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="<your_account_id>" # Cloudflare account ID
export CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN="<your_api_token>" # API token with Images:Edit permissions
```

Notes:

- If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, it will be sent as `Authorization: token <PAT>` (works for classic and fine-grained tokens).
- On a 401 with a provided token, the app retries unauthenticated automatically for resiliency.
- If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not set, requests are unauthenticated (no Authorization header), which may hit rate limits but should not 401.
- Make sure the token has not expired and has at least public repo read permissions.
- `CRON_SECRET` should be a random string used to authenticate cron job requests to refresh GitHub data.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN` are optional and enable automatic image hosting in Cloudflare Images with CDN optimization.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Cloudflare Workers (OpenNext)

This repo is configured to deploy with **OpenNext** to **Cloudflare Workers** (Pages-style static assets served by Workers).

### Caching System

The application uses intelligent caching to avoid GitHub API rate limits:

**Production (Cloudflare Workers):**

- **Cloudflare KV** storage for cached GitHub API responses
- **Cache TTL:** 6 hours (configurable in `src/lib/githubCache.ts`)
- **Automatic Refresh:** Cron trigger runs every 6 hours to refresh data

**Development (Local):**

- **File-based caching** in `.cache/` directory (automatically created)
- **Same TTL:** 6 hours to match production behavior
- **No KV dependency:** Works without Cloudflare infrastructure
- **Screenshot caching:** Separate 24-hour TTL for screenshot URLs

**Features:**

- **Fallback:** If caching fails, falls back to direct GitHub API calls
- **Smart Detection:** Automatically chooses the right cache based on environment
- **Transparent:** Users always get the latest data within the TTL window
- **Dual Caching:** Separate caches for project metadata (6h) and screenshots (24h)
- **Rate Limit Protection:** Minimizes GitHub API calls for both data and images
- **Cloudflare Images:** Optional image hosting with automatic optimization and CDN

The caching system ensures consistent behavior between development and production while efficiently managing API calls.

### Prerequisites

- Create a Cloudflare Pages project (build command will be handled by the GitHub Action).
- Generate a Cloudflare API token with Pages:Edit and Account:Read permissions.

### GitHub Secrets

Add these repository secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: API token with Pages permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
  (No Pages project needed; deployment uses `wrangler deploy`.)

### Build locally (optional)

```bash
npm install
npm run build:cf
# Outputs in `.open-next/` (assets + server functions)
```

### CI/CD

On push to `main`, the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will:

1. Install deps and run `
